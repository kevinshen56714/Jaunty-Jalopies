This is a car transaction CRUD application built with the MERN (MySQL-Express-React-Node) stack for different roles (owner, manager, salesperson, clerk) to trade/maintain vehicles.

This project involves object-oriented designs such as entity relationship diagram and designed database schema, promise based HTTP client via Axios, user-specific interface via React and establishing server API routes/controllers/models for MySQL database queries.
